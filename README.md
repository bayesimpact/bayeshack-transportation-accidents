> How can data help us heal communities at high risk for suicide?

## Prompt

A person or vehicle is hit by a train about once every three hours. This results in approximately 700 deaths per year, by accident and by suicide.

By creating descriptive models that examine empiric data on train fatalities and predictive models that can anticipate accidents and suicide attempts, we can decrease the number of deaths that occur and focus on communities that are at disproportinately high risk. Good data can be a focus national efforts to heal areas impacted by suicide, and to promote smart planning and routing to prevent accidents.
